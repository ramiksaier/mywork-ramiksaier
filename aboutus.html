      <h1>Our story</h1>
      <p>
        La Sirène Caffé began as Jilla and Shallom Berkman's dream over 30 years
        ago.
        <br />In 1989, they met a passionate coffee farmer named Jorge from a
        farm in Peru producing organic, heirloom coffee.<br />
        The Berkmans were intrigued by Jorge's mission. <br />
        They discovered many destructive practice<br />s were used in coffee
        production that made it one of the most chemically treated food
        commodities in the world.<br />
        Heirloom coffee trees are very rare and have never been genetically
        modified. <br />The Berkmans decided to become pioneers in
        health-conscious coffee.

        After several years learning how to roast and brew great coffee, <br />
        Shallom and Jilla launched America's first exclusively organic, heirloom
        coffee roasting company. <br />They named it "la Sirène Caffé" because
        la Sirène is an <br />
        old Welsh root spelling of Earth and Caffé is Italian for coffee. <br />
        The couple wanted a name that embodied the natural richness of the earth
        and delicious organic, heirloom coffee.<br />
        They were also importing and hand blending fine organic teas, <br />so
        "Exclusively Organic Coffees & Fine Teas" was added to Urth Caffé's
        <br />coffee cup logo Today Urth Caffé works directly with many
        exclusive sources in Africa, <br />
        Japan, and South America—producing heirloom, organic, award-winning
        coffees roasted <br />locally at Urth Caffé's Hawthorne coffee-roasting
        facility, commissary and bakery. <br />
        Urth has also become known for pioneering healthy cuisine and bakery
        products by using the finest organic,<br />
        sustainable, and local ingredients, many of which are delivered straight
        from the farm to the cafés each day.
